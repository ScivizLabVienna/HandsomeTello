# examples/photogrammetry

This folder will host a minimal end-to-end photogrammetry example using HandsomeTello.

Planned contents:
- capture_script.sh — scripted flight + image capture (simulated or restricted demo)
- camera calibration notes
- photogrammetry pipeline example (OpenMVG + OpenMVS or Meshroom) with expected outputs

Current status
- Placeholder. Please open issues to request specific capture workflows or to contribute sample datasets.
