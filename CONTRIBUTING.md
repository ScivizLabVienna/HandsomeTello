# Contributing to HandsomeTello

Thanks for your interest in contributing. To make contributions efficient and safe, please follow these guidelines.

1. Fork the repo and open a branch for your work.
2. Create an issue before large changes — describe scope, risks, and an estimated cost/time.
3. When opening PRs:
   - Include a clear description of the change, testing steps, and required hardware.
   - If the change relates to deferred features, add a short feasibility note and a rough hardware/software cost estimate.
   - Include safety/ethics considerations and a test plan for deployment or demos.
   - State the intended license for code/firmware components if different from the repository default (see README).

Ethics & Responsible Use
- All contributions that touch on deployment, payloads, or "microvandalism" research must include an ethics/responsible-use note.
- Do not include instructions or tooling intended to facilitate illegal activity.
- For experimental or risky work (firmware rooting, radio manipulation), prefer isolated branches and explicit lab-only disclaimers.

Legal / Licensing notes
- Documentation and media in this repository are licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0. Software/firmware is licensed under MIT by default. If you add software/firmware, please indicate whether you want to license it under MIT or another software-friendly license.

Code of Conduct
- All contributors are expected to follow CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md.

If you are a first-time contributor and want help getting started, open an issue and label it "good-first-issue".
